# A machine learning pipeline to classify sports articles
1. Introduction
Objective: Build a machine learning pipeline to classify sports articles scraped from websites like ESPN or Sports Illustrated.
Scope: The project includes:
Data scraping
Text preprocessing
Machine learning classification
Implementation of two neural networks
Outcome: A model that can classify articles into different sports categories (e.g., basketball, soccer, football, etc.).
2. Data Scraping
Objective: Collect sports articles from ESPN or Sports Illustrated.
Approach:
Use Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, or scrapy to scrape articles.
Extract relevant text (title, content) and metadata (e.g., category).
Save the data in a structured format (CSV/JSON).
Output: A dataset containing article text and their respective sport categories.
3. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Prepare the scraped data for model training.
Steps:
Clean the text (remove HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords, etc.).
Normalize text (convert to lowercase, lemmatize (converts words to their base form) (NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer), \
or stemming (Reduces words to their root form) NLTK's PorterStemmer for stemming).
Tokenize and vectorize the text (using methods like TF-IDF, ngram or word embeddings).
Output: A preprocessed dataset ready for model training.
4. Machine Learning Classification
Objective: Use a traditional machine learning algorithm for classification. Split the dataset into training and \
testing sets. Use classifiers like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forests. Evaluate \
the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Output: A baseline classification model.
5. Neural Network Models
5.1. Model 1: Simple Neural Network
Architecture:
Input layer: Accepts vectorized text.
Hidden layers: Fully connected layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU).

Implementation: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Objective: Establish a basic neural network model.
5.2. Model 2: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer
Options:
RNN variants: LSTM or GRU for handling sequential text data.
Transformer-based models: Use BERT, RoBERTa, or similar pre-trained models.
Objective: Leverage advanced deep learning techniques for better performance.
6. Model Evaluation
Steps:
Evaluate each model using the testing dataset.
Compare the performance of the ML classifier, simple NN, and advanced NN.
Use metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Deployment and Visualization
