# A machine learning pipeline to classify sports articles
1. Introduction
Objective: Build a machine learning pipeline to classify sports articles scraped from websites like ESPN or Sports Illustrated.
Scope: The project includes:
Data scraping
Text preprocessing
Machine learning classification
Implementation of two neural networks
Outcome: A model that can classify articles into different sports categories (e.g., basketball, soccer, football, etc.).
2. Data Scraping
Objective: Collect sports articles from ESPN or Sports Illustrated.
Approach:
Use Python libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, or scrapy to scrape articles.
Extract relevant text (title, content) and metadata (e.g., category).
Save the data in a structured format (CSV/JSON).
Output: A dataset containing article text and their respective sport categories.
3. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Prepare the scraped data for model training.
Steps:
Clean the text (remove HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords, etc.).
Normalize text (convert to lowercase, lemmatize, or stem).
Tokenize and vectorize the text (using methods like TF-IDF, ngram or word embeddings).
Output: A preprocessed dataset ready for model training.
4. Machine Learning Classification
Objective: Use a traditional machine learning algorithm for classification.
Steps:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Use classifiers like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forests.
Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Output: A baseline classification model.
5. Neural Network Models
5.1. Model 1: Simple Neural Network
Architecture:
Input layer: Accepts vectorized text.
Hidden layers: Fully connected layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
Output layer: Softmax for multi-class classification.
Implementation: Use TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Objective: Establish a basic neural network model.
5.2. Model 2: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer
Options:
RNN variants: LSTM or GRU for handling sequential text data.
Transformer-based models: Use BERT, RoBERTa, or similar pre-trained models.
Objective: Leverage advanced deep learning techniques for better performance.
6. Model Evaluation
Steps:
Evaluate each model using the testing dataset.
Compare the performance of the ML classifier, simple NN, and advanced NN.
Use metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. Deployment and Visualization
Objective: Make the project interactive and presentable.
Steps:
Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
Visualize results using charts and graphs (e.g., accuracy comparisons).
8. Conclusion
Summarize:
Key findings from the project.
Challenges faced and how they were addressed.
Future Scope:
Potential improvements (e.g., using more data, fine-tuning models, or adding categories).

## Key Recommendations:
For easier scraping: Consider Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports, or Fox Sports.
For rich tagging: ESPN, Goal.com, or CBS Sports.
Always review the Terms of Service for compliance before proceeding with scraping.
