https://www.si.com/nfl/super-bowl-newsletter-andy-reid-retirement-talk-was-unintentional,Super Bowl LIX Newsletter: Andy Reidâs Retirement Talk Was Unintentional,"Two years ago, on the eve of another Super Bowl appearance, rumors began to swirl in the Arizona desert. They centered on the future of Andy Reid, the Kansas City Chiefs head coach since 2013. Last week, Reid told Sports Illustrated that he believes he can trace their origins: to himself and his honesty, in interviews conducted earlier in â22. In them, Reid says he tried to do nothing more than lay out the parameters in play. He was 64 in the month of Super Bowl LVII and would turn 65 in March. He didnât expect to retire after clashing with his former team for another Lombardi Trophy. Didnât want to. Didnât need to. Wasnât being asked to. Reid also understood that many people retire at 65, a notion he saw as âkind of the thing to do.â But he had also asked his parents when they retired how they knew. âYouâll know when you know,â they told him. In relaying those factors for a decision Reid knew he wasnât ready to make yet, he believes he unintentionally set that mill, the rumor one, in motion. Even at the teamâs hotel two days before Super Bowl LVIIâs kickoff, many who loved Reid, who adored him and would have chained him to the offensive meeting room if that meant he wouldnât leave, were considering the same things as all the articles and news segments were asking. Three told SI then that they wonderedâlegitimately, wonderedâwhether Reid was closer to retiring than he was letting on. Two other sources inside that Chiefs team said they firmly believed him. Point is, concerns over Reidâs future in football, appeared at least â¦ plausible? âThatâs not where I was going,â he says now, a few days before his sixth Super Bowl appearance as a head coach. âI love it here, and thatâs not where Iâm at. I mean, Iâm in the latter part of my career. I got all that. I know today Iâm not ready, but, you know, if itâs one of those things, [where] all of a sudden you wake up and go, âWhoa,â you know? But thatâs not where Iâm at â¦ at all. Iâm enjoying what Iâm doing. But Iâm a realist, too. Iâm not getting any younger, so I get that.â The better question, then and now, is antithetical to the typical ones lobbed Reidâs way in this regard. Why leave? Thatâs the better question. Hall of Fame-bound quarterback, special even among quarterbacks already in the Hall of Fame, and only 29 â¦ check. Supportive ownership group â¦ check. Handpicked general manager who continues to rank among pro footballâs most deft, adept and adaptable executives â¦ check. Full control of the organization and the Chiefsâ prolific offense â¦ check. A tally of career wins (301 after the latest AFC championship triumph), just one shy of Bill Belichickâs tally, only 16 behind George Halas and 45 behind Don Shula, who is the winningest coach in football history with 347. If Reid coaches, say, three more seasons and the Chiefs average, say, 13 wins each year (regular season and playoffs combined) heâll come very close to the all-time wins mark for head coaches. And thatâs a conservative estimate. In the past three seasons, Kansas City has averaged 13.3 wins in the regular season and 16.7 wins overall. Take that overall average and extend into 2025âheâd have 318 or 319 career victoriesââ26 (between 334 and 336) and â27 (between 350 and 353). Why not make a run at immortality? Friend and former colleague Brad Childress told SI last week that no coach deserves that record more than Reid. âOne thousand percent,â he says. âNo matter how hard I triedâgetting in at 4:30 [a.m.] or 4:45, Iâd never beat him into the office. Six [a.m.] was late. There was never one time, whether it was the Vet, Lincoln Financial or the complex in Kansas City where his car wasnât in his space, and he wasnât already inside.â Patrick Mahomes says the Chiefs have never been healthier in his days as a starter for a playoff run. He says this while fully aware of the spate of injuries endured in the first quarter of the 2024 season. He doesnât say that everyone came back. Thatâs not true. One injury still hurts. âNo one really will talk about it,â he tells SI. âLosing Rashee Rice is still devastating. [Him being out] was huge for us during the yearâ[and not in a good way]. Heâs got the chance to be one of the best receivers in the NFL when he comes back next year.â Of Rice, Mahomes adds: âJust the consistency Rashee has; he has everything you need to be a No. 1 receiver in this league. And I think weâre gonna have a good problem in the future where we have a couple good receivers who are young and can play, and that includes Hollywood [Marquise Brown] as well. Weâre going to have more than one No. 1 receiver, but all those guys get along well, and itâs gonna be a good problem to have.â Mahomes pauses. Letâs out a small laugh. âLetâs go win the Super Bowl now, first,â he says. âAnd then weâll deal with that later.â In reference to the AFC championship game against the Cincinnati Bengals in January 2023. On why that day meant so much to him. âWell, the year before they put us out and went on to play the Rams in the Super Bowl. [The next year] was a full circle moment for me. Because in that game, I missed two critical checks where I had him [Joe Burrow] wrapped up, and he slipped out. I felt like it was my fault we lost that game. That weighed on me, personally, the whole offseason. We got to face him again, and when it came down to that third-down play, it was just one of those feelings. Like this was destined to happen.â In 14 seasons as the Philadelphia Eagles head coach, Reid won 140 games and made the playoffs in nine seasons. He even led Philadelphia to Super Bowl XXXIX, which New England won by three points. Those Eagles teams finished with a 10â9 mark in the postseason. Many franchises would be elated with such numbers. In Kansas City, after nearly 12 full seasons, Reid has already won more games (143) and holds a 16â6 record in the postseason. More importantly, he has won the game he supposedly could never win while in Philadelphia three timesâwith an opportunity to add to that total on Sunday. The difference? Not much beyond the narratives. âItâs really, different chapter, same book,â Childress says. âI donât see him having changed that much. He [has] always been steady. And it didnât make any difference whether we were on a USO trip to Afghanistan or just got our asses beat. Same game and all positive.â At Eagles media availability last week, there was much-guarded optimism over Brandon Grahamâs return to practice after he tore his triceps in Week 12. Itâs too early to read too deeply into whether heâll play in Super Bowl LIX, how often, or how well. That said, should he play, nobody in that organization would be surprised. Not at this point. âI think I have a different impact on the game than other people.â Thatâs Saquon Barkley, to the great Ben Baskin, who penned a memorable profile on Barkley before the NFL draft in 2018. The piece focused on Barkleyâs blueprint for professional football greatness. The path to now was, shall we say, scenic. But the blueprint Barkley enacted all those years ago is also pretty much what happened, with a few twists along the way.

https://www.si.com/nfl/myles-garrett-requests-trade-from-cleveland-browns-in-emotional-statement,Myles Garrett Requests Trade From Cleveland Browns in Emotional Statement,"Reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett sent shockwaves through the NFL on Monday morning as he formally requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns in an emotional statement. Here's a look at the letter he pennedâas shared by NFL insider Ian Rapoport: ""As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl - and that goal fuels me today more than ever,"" wrote Garrett. ""My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today."" ""While I've loved calling this city my home,"" he continued. ""My desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won't allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl. With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns."" Breaking: Reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year and #Browns star Myles Garrett has requested a trade. Exclusive statement: pic.twitter.com/LgS5YCeCnP As recently as last Tuesday, Browns general manager Andrew Berry relayed the organization's plans to try and keep Garrett in Cleveland until he retires. ""We're looking forward to him being on the field,"" said Berry last week via the team's website. ""Like I said in my [early January] press conference, we envision him going from Cleveland to Canton when his career is over... I think you can assume that we do anticipate at some point doing a third contract with Myles. We want him to retire here."" Garrett clearly sees it differentlyâeven using Berry's ""Cleveland to Canton"" moniker in his own statement. The 29-year-old was selected with the No. 1 overall pick by the Browns in the 2017 NFL draft andâdespite the team going just 53-78-1 in that spanâGarrett has made his mark over the last eight seasons. He's a four-time first-team All-Pro, a two-time second-team All-Pro, a six-time Pro Bowler, and was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year in 2023. feed Mike Kadlick is a contributor to the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.

https://www.si.com/nba/luka-doncic-trade-has-inspired-teams-to-call-suns-about-kevin-durant,The Luka Doncic Trade Has Inspired Teams to Call the Suns About Kevin Durant,"Zach Lowe was laid off by ESPN in the fall and has been quiet since, but the Luka Doncic trade had him dusting off his old podcasting equipment to react to the ""most shocking trade in the history of the NBA."" Lowe remains plugged in and people were thrilled to see and hear him chime in on the Doncic for Anthony Davis trade and he delivered, questioning everything about the deal from the Mavericks' side, while also pointing out that Dallas still has a pretty nice team. One of the more interesting parts of the video was when he talked about how shaken up the entire league was by the move and it may have led to more teams asking Phoenix about Kevin Durant. I screwed up the ""welcome to"" but I had to. pic.twitter.com/WweA8cEWIc Zach Lowe: Teams are currently calling about asking about Kevin Durantâ¦. pic.twitter.com/aVOHPvjcDn ""A lot of it swirling around Phoenix,"" said Lowe. ""Forget the Jimmy Butler stuff. That's swirling, but lot of it's swirling around Phoenix. A lot of teams wondering... Durant? What's going on with Durant? You guys gonna take some calls? You guys taking calls? I think KD probably wants to stay in Phoenix but who knows on that front."" Durant called the Doncic trade ""crazy"" on Sunday and pointed out that players are held to a different standard than teams when it comes to player movement. Aftrer this season Durant has one year and $54 million remaining on his contract. He was traded to Phoenix in early 2023, but has only won one playoff series in two postseasons. At 25-23 Phoenix is currently the eighth best team in the Western Conference. feed Stephen Douglas is a senior writer on the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.

https://www.si.com/nfl/chip-kelly-raiders-salary-tom-brady,"Raiders, Tom Brady Made Chip Kelly the Highest Paid Coordinator in Return to NFL","The Las Vegas Raiders made a major splash in the coaching world on Sunday afternoon when they hired Chip Kelly as their next offensive coordinator and apparently, they paid up to do so. According to Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer, Kelly will make $6 million per year in his return to the NFLâa number that makes him the highest-paid coordinator in the league. ""The Raiders told candidates during their search they were making a serious commitment with an infusion of cash from the new owners,"" wrote Breer in a post on X (formerly Twitter). ""Here it isâChip Kelly was lured to Vegas with a deal averaging $6 million per year, per sources."" The @Raiders told candidates during their search they were making a serious commitment with an infusion of cash from the new owners. Here it isâChip Kelly was lured to Vegas with a deal averaging $6 million per year, per sources.Kelly is now the NFL's highest-paid coordinator. Said ""new owners"" include former Patriots quarterback and current FOX broadcaster Tom Bradyâwhose minority stake in the franchise was officially approved this past October. Brady was reportedly ""influential"" in the Raiders' decision to fire general manager Tom Telesco and head coach Antonio Pierce last month, and also played a prominent role in the search to replace them. After striking out on Ben Johnson, Las Vegas hired Pete Carroll as their next head coach on Jan. 25. They now pair him with Kelly at OC, who returns to the NFL for the first time since 2016. Ohio State's offense under Kelly scored 35.7 points per game and gained 429.4 yards per game in 2024-25 on their way to a national championship. feed Mike Kadlick is a contributor to the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.
